# Scanners

In theory, all scanners Sane-compatible or WIA2-compatible should work.
In practice, there are always slight differences that can cause bugs.

Here is a list of scanners that are known to work with Pyinsane2.

If your scanner is not in the list:

* Either it works, in which case feel free to report it (by pull request or [email](mailto:jflesch@openpaper.work))
* Or it doesn't, in which case please open a [ticket](https://github.com/openpaperwork/pyinsane/issues/new) with a maximum of information
